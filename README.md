# Overview
Combining the advantages of multi-rotor vertical takeoff and landing and the high speed and long flight time of fixed wing, it can take off and land vertically to adapt to the complex and narrow terrain such as mountains and crowded cities. It can effectively improve the problems of short flight time and limited range of motion of multi-rotor uav. It can take off, hover, tilt, fly and land. It can take off vertically and, once at a certain height, tilt the rotors to move forward. Normally, conventional drone maneuver by varying the speed of rotation of motor. This causes the drone to lean in that direction, but in the case of the VTOL drone, it remains parallel to the ground.

# Hardware Requirements
Teensy 4.0, MPU6050, Servo and Other necessary components required to build the drone.
