# Overview
Combining the advantages of multi-rotor vertical takeoff and landing with the high speed and extended flight time of fixed-wing aircraft, this drone can take off and land vertically, making it ideal for complex, narrow terrains like mountains and crowded cities. It effectively addresses the issues of short flight times and limited range typically faced by multi-rotor UAVs. The drone is capable of vertical takeoff, hovering, tilting, flying, and landing. After taking off vertically, it tilts its rotors to transition to forward flight once it reaches a certain altitude. Unlike conventional drones, which maneuver by varying motor speeds to tilt in the desired direction, VTOL drones remain parallel to the ground while flying.

# Hardware Requirements
Teensy 4.0, MPU6050, Servo and Other necessary components required to build the drone.
